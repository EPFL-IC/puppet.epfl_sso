# coding: utf-8
# Class: epfl_sso::krb5
#
# Integrate the computer into Kerberos
#
# This class is the translation in Puppet of
# https://fuhm.net/linux-and-active-directory/
#
# Unlike Windows, this approach does *not* preclude cloning - A number
# of VMs can share the same Kerberos credentials with no issues.
# *However*, one should *not* run this class periodically in this use
# case (or alternatively, all clones should have a different hostname)
#
# === Parameters:
#
# $initialize::  True iff we want to create credentials (as opposed to
#            renewing them). AS FOR NOW THIS IS THE ONLY SUPPORTED
#            MODE OF OPERATION. Requires running "kinit AD123456"
#            first (replace 123456 with your SCIPER)
#
# $ad_server::
#
# $ou_path::
#
# === Actions:
#
# * Create Active Directory-compatible entries in /etc/krb5.keytab
#   (updating them is not supported yet)
#
